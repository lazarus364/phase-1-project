//Write a JavaScript program that manages student grades.
//The program should: Prompt the user to input multiple student names and their corresponding marks (marks should be between 0 and 100).

//If the input is invalid, display an error message and prompt the user to enter the mark again.
//Assign grades based on the following criteria:
//A: Marks greater than 79
//B: Marks between 60 and 79 (inclusive)
//C: Marks between 50 and 59 (inclusive)
//D: Marks between 40 and 49 (inclusive)
//E: Marks less than 40

//Allow the user to end the input process by typing "done" instead of entering a student's name. Display the student names, their marks, and the corresponding grades.
